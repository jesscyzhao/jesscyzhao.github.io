# Spatial Point processes modeling

Point pattern data is a unique type of spatial data where the location of incidence is considered random. Point processes model the occurrence and location of a certain incidence over time or in a bounded region. My current research focuses on developing models for spatial point process that are both flexible and computationally efficient over irregular observation windows.

- 2019, Working paper 
- Develop a novel approach to model the Non-homogeneous Poisson Process with Bernstein Polynomials mixture while retaining a connection to a Dirichlet Process prior placed on the NHPP density function. 
- The model is computationally effective via close-form MCMC updates and minimal numerical approximation for the computation of total intensity.  
- Develop a extension to model point pattern over irregular domains, e.g. the boundary of Boston city that deals with the truncation and scaling of point patterns with well-defined intensity function representation and computation efficiency.
