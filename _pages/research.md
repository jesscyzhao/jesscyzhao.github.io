# Spatial point process modeling

Point pattern data is a unique type of spatial data where the location of incidence is considered random. Point processes model the occurrence and location of a certain incidence over time or in a bounded region. My current research focuses on developing models for spatial point process that are both flexible and computationally efficient over irregular observation windows.  

## _Modeling for Poisson process over irregular spatial domains_

- A Bayesian nonparametric prior for the Poisson process intensity function that respects the shape of the irregular domain 
- A unified prior model for the intensity function and total intensity  
- Flexible (implies a Bernstein-Dirichlet prior on the Poisson density function) and computationally efficient (efficient Gibbs updates in the posterior simulation) 
- Draft is available [here](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/research/technical-reports/UCSC-SOE-19-10)
