## "Bernstein Polynomial modelling for Poisson Process intensity" with Athanasios Kottas

- Work in progress 
- Abstract: We propose a novel modelling approach for Poisson processes over time or space. We use the Bernstein Polynomial basis functions as mixture component to represent the nonhomogeneous Poisson process intensity function. We find this mixture representation with Bernstein Polynomials equivalent to a nonparametric Dirichlet process prior placed on the Poisson process density function. In particular, our model offers a framework that yields a close-form expression for the Poisson process total intensity and intensity function with the same set of parameters. As a result, a key feature of such models is that they are computationally efficient by avoiding numerical approximations often used by earlier approaches to evaluate total intensity in regular spatial domain. This feature is especially important in dealing with spatial point patterns over irregular domain, which is often the case in applications and thus proposes challenges related to evaluating the truncated version of the intensity function. We are able to extend our model for regular domains to irregular ones without adding much computational overhead and utilize well-performing Monte Carlo approach to achieve truncation. We address issues relating to choice of the Dirichlet process prior, number of basis functions, and develop methods for prior specification and posterior simulation for full inference about the intensity function of the nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Further, we discuss ways to deal with some specific shape of irregular domain and computational approach to evaluate normalizing constants to achieve truncation. The methodology is illustrated with simulated and real data sets.
