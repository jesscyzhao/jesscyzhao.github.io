PhD Student, Department of Statistics, UC Santa Cruz 

[UCSC Statistics](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/stats)

I am a third year PhD student at UCSC working on Nonparametric Bayesian methods for modeling spatial point processes. I have the good fortune to be advised by [Prof. Athanasios Kottas](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~thanos/).

My research interests include spatial statistics, Bayesian nonparametric methods, and mixture models. I am also interested in high-performance computing and am a big fan of [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist at Two Six Capital and specialized in statistical modeling and programming, and studied math at [Bowdoin College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/).
